# Node.js CRUD & Data Visualization Web App

Demonstration link is coming soon! Once I deploy the application, this section will be updated.

## Description
This application is a CRUD app built with JavaScript and the Node.js runtime environment, and contains data visualization for the data within the application. This project was developed as an academic project during my final semester at Algonquin College, and served as my first project using Node.js. With this project I applied project planning, research, testing, and the implementation of advanced concepts from past courses for this Node.js project.

The entire project was split into four different assignments, each serving as steps to completing the application in its entirety. Although not included in this respository, I used the [ProjectLibre](https://www.projectlibre.com/products) software for the project planning portions of each assignment and was expected to plan out my self study in order to meet the deadlines.

## Framework / Libraries Used
Below is a complete list of libraries used within this project:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) - Back-end JavaScript runtime environment
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web application framework, providing a variety of feature for building this web app. So far, it is primarily used for database.
* [MySQL](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/) - Allows JavaScript to obtain data from local MySQL database.

## How to Run / Use the Project

###IMPORTANT: To run this project, you must have a local MySQL database on your computer, and the following [dataset](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1d41c12a-4d33-8992-e651-d76e481c7862/resource/51bdbad9-d6c2-4c9e-9bef-7ea0edbb3887?inner_span=True) within the databse.

At the moment, this project has not yet been deployed since it is still in development. However, if you're interested in running this application, you can follow the steps below:
1. Download the project / clone this repository onto Visual Studio Code or IDE of your choice.
2. After cloning the repository, navigate over to the frontend directory using `cd frontend` and run the `npm start` command in the IDE's terminal to determine what dependencies need to be installed for the project to run. Run `npm install` with the proceeding module name to install the required dependencies.
3. Navigate over to the project's main directory, and run the `node app.js` command to run the project in the terminal.
4. If necessary, ensure that all dependencies are installed utilizing the `npm install` command for each dependency.
